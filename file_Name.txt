Are you not yet a coder? Are you trying to be a coder? Are you already a good coder? Anything you are! Anything you want to be! Place where you are trying to reach, there is already someone somewhere, you can even go beyond. Getting there may be fast or may take a little longer. But always tell yourself, you can- it is not a fake statement or delusion to you by yourself, it is the absolute truth- you are really capable! Nothing is bigger than you!

In either of the cases- please take care of your physical and mental health with the highest priority without any compromise, otherwise, nothing will be harmonious even if you are big, a very big one at your dream place!
